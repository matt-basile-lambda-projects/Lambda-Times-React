What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript.

- PropTypes are used to check the data types you are receiving from other components via props. It's important to check and understand the data type we are using so that the methods and functions we apply to them or the way we pass them to other components works properly. If we know the type of data we hav e we can avoid applying the inappropriate methods which will cause less bugs in the future.
